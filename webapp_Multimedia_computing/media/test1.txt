The Spectacular Eruptionof  Mount St. Helens
A
The eruption in May 1980 of Mount St. Helens, Washington State, astoundedthe world with its violence. A gigantic explosion tore much of the volcano'ssummit to fragments; the energy released was equal to that of 500 of the nuclear  bombs that destroyed Hiroshima in 1945.
B
The event occurred along the boundary of two of the moving plates thatmake up the Earth's crust. They meet at the junction of the North Americancontinent and the Pacific Ocean. One edge of the continental North American plate over-rides the oceanic Juan de Fuca micro-plate, producing the volcanicCascade range that includes Mounts Baker, Rainier and Hood, and Lassen Peak as well as Mount St. Helens.

Until Mount St. Helens began to stir, only Mount Baker and Lassen Peak hadshown signs of life during the 20th century. According to geological evidencefound by the United States Geological Survey, there had been two major eruptions of Mount St. Helens in the recent (geologically speaking)past: around1900 B.C., and about A.D. 1500. Since the arrival of Europeans in the region, ithad experienced a single period of spasmodic activity, between 1831 and 1857.Then, for more than a century, Mount St. Helens lay dormant.

By 1979, the Geological Survey, alerted by signs of renewed activity, had been monitoring the volcano for 18 months. It warned the local populationagainst being deceived by the mountain's outward calm, and forecast that aneruption would take place before the end of the century. The inhabitants of thearea did not have to wait that long. On March 27, 1980,a few clouds of smokeformed above the summit , and slight tremors were felt. On the 28th, larger anddarker clouds,. consisting of gas and ashes,. emerged and climbed as high as20,000 feet. In April a slight lull ensued, but the volcanologists remained pessimistic. The, in early May, the northern flank of the mountain bulged, andthe summit rose by 500 feet.

Steps were taken to evacuate the population. Most- campers, hikers
